    <h3>Our Founders</h3>
    <p>Our founder, Thalia Schneider is truly the biggest potato fan you will ever meet! 
        She loves them in every single form you can imagine. Having experienced the wonder 
        of America's many amazing french fries; amazing and flavorful mexican papitas; 
        jewish latkas, australian battered potatoes; the list goes on. A hard working college
        graduate, she founded this company with the money she made from her college jobs and her
        desire to share the amazing international potato flavors with the world. We are a small
        family owned business with a passion for doing things right, and what we do is make delicious
        potatoes.
